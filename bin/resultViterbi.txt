German I
bureaucracy I
has O
for O
some I
time I
been O
pushing O
for O
relaxation I
within O
their I
country I
. O

The I
older I
generation I
has O
been O
torn O
between O
a I
fear I
of O
tampering O
with O
the I
status I
quo I
and O
a I
fear I
of O
what I
might O
happen O
if O
they I
did O
n't O
. O

From O
the I
perspective I
of O
East I
Germany I
's B
old I
guard I
, O
reforms I
that O
smack O
of O
capitalism I
and O
Western-style I
democracy I
could O
eliminate O
their I
country I
's B
reason I
for O
being O
. O

Unlike O
the I
other I
nations I
of O
the I
bloc I
, O
East I
Germany I
is O
a I
creature I
of O
the I
Cold I
War I
. O

Erasing O
the I
differences I
still O
dividing O
Europe I
, O
and O
the I
vast I
international I
reordering I
that B
implies O
, O
wo O
n't O
endanger O
the I
statehood I
of O
a I
Poland I
or O
a I
Hungary I
. O

But O
it I
could O
ultimately O
lead O
to O
German I
reunification I
and O
the I
disappearance I
of O
East I
Germany I
from O
the I
map I
. O

Which I
is O
what I
the B
Old I
Guard I
fears I
. O

`` O
I I
'm O
sure O
they I
'll O
formulate O
a I
reform I
that B
will O
be O
a I
recipe I
for O
the I
GDR I
's B
future I
as O
a I
separately I
identifiable I
state I
, O
'' O
says O
Michael I
Simmons I
, O
a I
British I
journalist I
whose B
book I
on O
East I
Germany I
, O
entitled O
`` O
The I
Unloved I
Country I
, O
'' O
was O
published O
this I
month I
. O

Up O
to O
now O
, O
that I
recipe I
has O
consisted O
of O
a I
dogged I
effort I
by O
former I
leader I
Walter I
Ulbricht I
to O
establish O
the I
country I
's B
international I
legitimacy I
, O
followed O
by O
Mr. I
Honecker I
's B
campaign I
to O
build O
the I
East I
bloc I
's I
only I
successful I
Stalinist I
economy I
into O
a I
consumer I
paradise I
. O

Neither O
man I
achieved O
perfection I
. O

Early O
in O
1987 I
, O
Mr. I
Honecker I
and O
his I
team I
stopped O
paying O
thin I
compliments I
to O
Mr. I
Gorbachev I
and O
joined O
with O
Romania I
in O
rejecting O
any I
necessity I
for O
adjustments I
in O
their I
systems I
. O

The I
less-self-confident I
Czechoslovaks I
and I
Bulgarians I
, O
in O
contrast I
, O
declared O
their I
intentions I
to O
reform O
, O
while O
doing O
nothing I
concrete O
about O
it I
. O

The I
East I
German I
media I
soon O
began O
presenting O
Mr. I
Gorbachev I
's B
speeches I
only O
as O
sketchy I
summaries I
, O
and O
giving O
space I
to O
his I
opponents I
. O

By O
late I
1988 I
, O
they I
were O
banning O
Soviet I
publications I
. O

The I
country I
abandoned O
its I
former I
devotion I
to O
socialist I
unity I
and O
took O
to O
insisting O
instead O
that O
each I
country I
in O
the I
bloc I
ought O
to O
travel O
its I
own I
road I
. O

Mr. I
Honecker I
spoke O
of O
`` O
generally O
valid I
objective I
laws I
of O
socialism I
'' O
and O
left O
no I
room I
for O
debate I
. O

With O
this I
year I
's B
dislocations I
in O
China I
and O
the I
Soviet I
Union I
, O
and O
the I
drive I
to O
democracy I
in O
Poland I
and O
Hungary I
, O
the I
East I
German I
leadership I
grew O
still O
more O
defensive O
. O

Politburo I
member I
Joachim I
Herrman I
confessed O
to O
a I
`` I
grave I
concern I
'' O
over O
Hungarian I
democracy I
. O

`` O
Under O
the I
banner I
that B
proclaims O
the I
` I
renewal I
of O
socialism I
, O
' O
'' O
he I
said O
, O
`` O
forces I
are O
at O
work I
that B
are O
striving O
to O
eliminate O
socialism I
. O
'' O

Some I
loyal I
voices I
, O
in O
and O
out O
of O
the I
East I
German I
Communist I
party I
, O
saw O
the I
nation I
's B
unrest I
coming I
. O

The I
first I
signs I
were O
economic O
. O

Despite O
heavily I
subsidized I
consumer I
industries I
, O
East I
Germans I
have O
for O
years I
watched O
the I
West I
pull I
farther O
out O
ahead O
. O

In O
1988 I
, O
for O
the I
first I
time I
, O
economic I
growth I
came O
to O
a I
dead I
stop I
. O

Gingerly O
, O
some I
economists I
began O
to O
blame O
central I
planning I
. O

Some I
writers I
in O
theoretical I
journals I
even O
raised O
the I
notion I
of O
introducing O
democracy I
, O
at I
least I
in O
the I
workplace I
. O

By O
summer I
, O
an I
independent I
reform I
movement I
was O
saying O
out O
loud I
what I
it B
had O
only O
whispered O
before O
. O

But O
they I
are O
stalwart I
socialists I
. O

Their I
proclaimed I
purpose I
is O
to O
cleanse O
East I
Germany I
of O
its I
Stalinist I
muck I
, O
not O
to O
merge O
with O
the I
West I
. O

One I
of O
their I
pastors I
has O
envisioned O
a I
`` I
new I
utopia I
'' O
of O
`` O
creative I
socialism I
. O
'' O

Meanwhile O
, O
the I
man I
Mr. I
Krenz I
replaces O
has O
left O
an I
indelible I
mark I
on O
East I
German I
society I
. O

Imprisoned O
by O
the I
Nazis I
during O
World I
War I
II I
for O
his I
political I
beliefs I
, O
Mr. I
Honecker I
typified O
the I
postwar I
generation I
of O
committed O
Communist I
leaders I
in O
Eastern I
Europe I
who B
took O
their I
cues I
from O
Moscow I
. O

He I
was O
a I
`` I
socialist I
warrior I
'' I
who I
felt O
rankled O
by O
West I
Germany I
's B
enormous I
postwar I
prosperity I
and O
the I
Bonn I
government I
's B
steadfast I
refusal I
to O
recognize O
the I
legitimacy I
of O
his I
state I
. O

Finally O
, O
during O
his I
first I
and I
only I
state I
visit I
to O
Bonn I
two I
years I
ago O
, O
he I
won O
some I
measure I
of O
the I
recognition I
he B
had O
long O
sought O
. O

But O
ultimately O
he I
was O
undone O
by O
forces I
unleashed O
by O
his I
own I
comrade I
, O
Mr. I
Gorbachev I
. O

Mr. I
Honecker I
's B
removal I
`` O
was O
bound O
to O
happen O
, O
'' O
says O
one I
aide I
to O
Chancellor O

`` O

the I
USAir I

represents O

of O
all I
the I

that O
Mr. I
Steinhardt I
manages O
. O

A I
week I
ago O
, O
USAir I
stock I
briefly I
soared O
above O
52 I
after O
a I
report I
in O
USA I
Today I
that O
Mr. I
Steinhardt I
might O
launch O
a I
hostile I
bid I
for O
the I
carrier I
, O
though O
takeover I
speculators I
say O
they I
were O
skeptical O
. O

`` O
If O
USAir I
is O
worth O
80 I
as O
a I
takeover I
and O
the I
stock I
went O
to O
52 I
, O
the I
market I
was O
saying O
Steinhardt I
's B
presence I
was O
n't O
worth I
anything I
, O
in O
terms I
of O
getting O
a I
deal I
done O
, O
'' O
says O
a I
veteran I
takeover I
speculator I
. O

Traders I
say O
this I
all I
goes O
to O
show O
that O
even I
the I
smartest I
money I
manager I
can O
get O
infected O
with O
crowd I
passions I
. O

In O
trying O
to O
raid O
USAir I
, O
Mr. I
Steinhardt I
abandoned O
his I
usual I
role I
as O
a I
passive I
investor I
, O
and O
ran O
into O
snags I
. O

Moreover O
, O
unlike O
Mr. I
Buffett I
, O
who I
often O
holds O
big I
stakes I
in O
companies I
for O
years I
, O
Mr. I
Steinhardt I
has O
n't O
in O
the I
past I
done O
much I
long-term I
investing I
. O

Mr. I
Steinhardt I
, O
who I
runs O
about I
$ I
1.7 I
billion I
for O
Steinhardt I
Partners I
, O
made O
his I
name I
as O
a I
gunslinging I
trader I
, O
moving O
in O
and O
out O
of O
stocks I
with O
agility I
-- O
enriching O
himself I
and O
his I
investment I
clients I
. O

Meanwhile O
, O
his I
big I
losses I
, O
for O
instance I
in O
1987 I
's B
crash I
, O
generally O
have O
been O
trading I
losses I
. O

So O
, O
some I
see O
a I
special I
irony I
in O
the I
fact I
that O
Mr. I
Steinhardt I
, O
the I
trader I
, O
now O
is O
encumbered O
with O
a I
massive I
, I
illiquid I
airline I
holding I
. O

Analysts I
say O
USAir I
stock I
might O
lose O
four I
or I
five I
points I
if O
the I
Steinhardt I
stake I
was O
dumped O
all I
at O
once O
. O

As O
a I
result I
, O
Mr. I
Steinhardt I
must O
reconcile O
himself I
to O
selling O
USAir I
at O
a I
loss I
, O
or O
to O
holding O
the I
shares I
as O
an I
old-fashioned I
investment I
. O

`` O
Long-term I
investing I
-- O
that I
's O
not O
Steinhardt I
's B
style I
, O
'' O
chuckles O
an I
investor I
who B
once O
worked O
at O
Steinhardt I
Partners I
. O

`` O
He I
does O
n't O
usually O
risk O
that O
much I
unless O
he I
thinks O
he I
has O
an I
ace I
in O
the I
hole I
, O
'' O
adds O
another I
Steinhardt I
Partners I
alumnus I
. O

In O
recent I
days I
, O
traders I
say O
USAir I
has O
been O
buying O
its I
own I
shares I
, O
as O
part I
of O
a I
program I
to O
retire O
about I
eight I
million I
USAir I
shares I
, O
though O
the I
carrier I
wo O
n't O
discuss O
its I
buy-back I
program I
. O

If O
USAir I
stepped O
up O
its I
share I
purchases I
, O
that I
might O
be O
a I
way I
for O
Mr. I
Steinhardt I
to O
get O
out O
, O
says O
Timothy I
Pettee I
, O
a I
Merrill I
Lynch I
analyst I
. O

But O
USAir I
might O
not O
want O
to O
help O
Mr. I
Steinhardt I
, O
he I
adds O
. O

In O
1987 I
, O
USAir I
Chairman I
Edwin I
Colodny I
stonewalled O
when O
Trans I
World I
Airlines I
Chairman I
Carl I
Icahn I
threatened O
to O
take O
over O
the I
carrier I
. O

Mr. I
Icahn I
, O
a I
much I
more O
practiced I
raider I
than O
Mr. I
Steinhardt I
, O
eventually O
sold O
a I
big I
USAir I
stake I
at O
a I
tiny I
profit I
through O
Bear I
, O
Stearns I
. O

Mr. I
Steinhardt I
also O
could O
take O
that I
route I
. O

He I
confers O
big I
trading I
commissions I
on O
Wall I
Street I
firms I
. O

However O
, O
with O
airline I
stocks I
cratering O
, O
he I
might O
not O
get O
a I
very I
good I
price I
for O
his I
shares I
, O
traders I
say O
. O

Especially O
galling O
for O
Mr. I
Steinhardt I
, O
say O
people I
close O
to O
him I
, O
is O
that O
USAir I
's B
Mr. I
Colodny I
wo O
n't O
even O
take O
his I
telephone I
calls I
. O

While O
USAir I
is O
n't O
considered O
absolutely O
takeover-proof O
, O
its I
defenses I
, O
including O
the I
sale I
in O
August I
of O
a I
12 I
% I
stake I
in O
the I
company I
to O
Mr. I
Buffett I
's B
Berkshire I
Hathaway I
, O
are O
pretty O
strong O
. O

USAir I
's B
deal I
with O
Mr. I
Buffett I
`` O
was O
n't O
exactly O
a I
shining I
example I
of O
shareholder I
democracy I
, O
'' O
Mr. I
Steinhardt I
says O
. O

Since O
last I
April I
, O
the I
investor I
has O
made O
seven I
so-called I
13D I
filings I
in O
USAir I
, O
as O
he I
bought O
and O
sold O
the I
company I
's B
stock I
. O

Such I
disclosures I
of O
big I
holdings I
often O
are O
used O
by O
raiders I
to O
try O
to O
scare O
a I
company I
's B
managers I
, O
and O
to O
stir O
interest I
in O
the I
stock I
. O

But O
of O
course I
it B
would O
be O
highly I
unusual O
for O
an I
investment I
fund I
such O
as O
Steinhardt I
Partners I
to O
take O
over O
a I
company I
. O

USAir I
and O
Mr. I
Buffett I
wo O
n't O
talk O
about O
Mr. I
Steinhardt I
at O
all I
. O

Analysts I
say O
USAir I
has O
great I
promise I
. O

By O
the I
second I
half I
of O
1990 I
, O
USAir I
stock I
could O
hit O
60 I
, O
says O
Helane I
Becker I
of O
Shearson I
Lehman I
Hutton I
. O

She I
thinks O
traders I
should O
buy O
the I
stock I
if O
it I
tumbles O
to O
35 I
. O

But O
meanwhile O
, O
USAir I
is O
expected O
to O
show O
losses I
or O
lackluster I
profit I
for O
several I
quarters I
as O
it I
tries O
to O
digest O
Piedmont I
Airlines I
, O
which I
it B
acquired O
. O

Moreover O
, O
some I
investors I
think O
a I
recession I
or O
renewed I
airfare I
wars I
will O
pummel O
airline I
stocks I
in O
coming O
months I
. O

However O
, O
Mr. I
Steinhardt I
says O
he I
's O
`` O
comfortable I
holding I
USAir I
as O
an I
investment I
. O
'' O

While O
he I
has O
bought O
and O
sold O
some I
USAir I
shares I
in O
recent I
days I
, O
he I
says O
that O
contrary O
to O
rumors I
, O
he I
has O
n't O
tried O
to O
unload O
his I
holding I
. O

Mr. I
Steinhardt I
adds O
that O
he I
bought O
USAir I
stock I
earlier B
this I
year I
as O
`` O
part I
of O
a I
fundamental I
investment I
in O
the I
airline I
group I
. O
'' O

In O
1989 I
, O
Mr. I
Steinhardt I
says O
he I
made O
money I
trading I
in O
Texas I
Air I
, O
AMR I
and O
UAL I
. O

Overall O
, O
his I
investments I
so O
far O
this I
year I
are O
showing O
gains I
of O
about I
20 I
% I
, O
he I
adds O
. O

Does O
Mr. I
Steinhardt I
regret O
his I
incursion I
into O
the I
takeover-threat I
game I
? O

People I
close O
to O
the I
investor I
say O
that I
was O
an I
experiment I
he B
is O
unlikely O
to O
repeat O
. O

`` O
I I
do O
n't O
think O
you I
'll O
find O
I I
'm O
making O
a I
radical I
change I
in O
my I
traditional I
investment I
style I

'' O
Mr. I
Steinhardt I
says O

Addington I
Resources I
Inc. I
said O
it I
called O
for O
redemption I
on O
Nov. I
21 I
its I
$ I
25.8 I
million I
outstanding O
of O
8 I
% I
convertible I

due O

The I

were O
issued O
in O

face I
amount I
of O

on O

, O
the I
Ashland I
, O

, O

, O
water I
transportation I
and I
construction I
company I
said O
. O

The I
company I
said O
the I
redemption I
is O
permitted O
because O
the I
price I
of O
Addington I
's B
stock I
has O
equaled O
or O
exceeded O
$ I
19.60 I
for O
20 I
consecutive I
trading I
days I
, O
a I
condition I
set O
in O
the I
terms I
of O
the I
debentures I
. O

Debenture I
holders I
are O
expected O
to O
convert O
most I
of O
the I
debentures I
into O
common I
because O
the I
value I
of O
the I
stock I
received O
in O
a I
conversion I
would O
exceed O
the I
$ I
1,103.11 I

price I

Commodore I
International I
Ltd. I
said O
it I
will O
report O
a I
loss I
for O
the I
first I
quarter I
ended O
Sept. I
30 I
because O
sales I
of O
personal I
computers I
for O
the I
home I
market I
remained O
weak O
in O
some I
major I
countries I
. O

That I
will O
mark O
the I
second I
consecutive I
quarterly I
loss I
for O
Commodore I
and O
will O
raise O
additional I
questions I
about O
whether O
it I
can O
sustain O
the I
turnaround I
it B
had O
seemed O
to O
be O
engineering I
. O

Commodore I
, O
West I
Chester I
, O
Pa. I
, O
had O
said O
in O
August I
that O
it I
was O
consolidating O
manufacturing I
to O
cut O
costs I
and O
expected O
to O
be O
profitable O
in O
the I
fiscal I
first I
quarter I
. O

Commodore I
said O
that O
its I
announcement I
is O
based O
on O
preliminary I
information I
and O
that O
the I
situation I
could O
look O
different O
by O
the I
time I
final I
results I
are O
announced O
early I
next I
month I
. O

In O
fact I
, O
Commodore I
's B
fiscal I
fourth-quarter I
loss I
was O
$ I
2 I
million I
narrower O
than O
Commodore I
had O
expected O
a I
few I
weeks I
after O
the I
quarter I
closed O
. O

Still O
, O
even O
results O
approaching O
break-even I
would O
mark O
a I
sharp I
weakening I
compared O
with O
fiscal I
1989 I
first-quarter I
earnings I
of O
$ I
9.6 I
million I
, O
or O
30 I
cents I
a B
share I
, O
on O
sales I
of O
$ I
200.2 I
million I
. O

Reflecting O
concerns I
about O
Commodore I
's B
outlook I
, O
its I
stock I
has O
plunged O
more I
than I
50 I
% I
since O
May I
, O
closing I
yesterday I
unchanged O
at O
$ I
8.875 I
a B
share I
in O
composite I
trading I
on O
the I
New I
York I
Stock I
Exchange I
. O

The I
price I
can O
be O
expected O
to O
erode O
further O
, O
because O
the I
loss I
estimate I
came O
after O
the I
market I
closed O
. O

Commodore I
has O
seemed O
to O
be O
setting O
the I
stage I
recently O
for O
progress I
in O
the I
U.S. I
, O
where O
its I
personal-computer I
sales I
have O
been O
so O
dismal O
for O
years I
that O
Commodore I
is O
close O
to O
dropping O
off O
research I
firms I
' B
market-share I
charts I
. O

Commodore I
has O
assembled O
an I
experienced I
management I
team I
, O
it I
has O
persuaded O
many O
more I
dealers I
to O
carry O
its I
products I
and O
it I
has O
unleashed O
a I
slick I
advertising I
campaign I
. O

But O
those I
represent O
long-term I
strategies I
that O
probably O
wo O
n't O
succeed O
quickly O
, O
even O
if O
they I
turn O
out O
to O
be O
the I
right I
ones I
. O

In O
the I
meantime I
, O
the I
strategies I
will O
increase O
expenses I
. O

Commodore I
had O
been O
counting O
on O
its I
consumer I
business I
to O
stay O
sufficiently O
healthy O
to O
support O
its I
efforts I
in O
other I
areas I
-- O
mainly O
in O
getting O
schools I
and I
businesses I
to O
use O
its I
Amiga I
, O
which I
has O
slick I
graphics I
yet O
has O
been O
slow O
to O
catch O
on O
because O
it I
is O
n't O
compatible O
with O
Apple I
Computer I
Inc. I
or O
International I
Business I
Machines I
Corp. I
hardware I
. O

But O
sales I
to O
consumers I
have O
become O
difficult O
during O
the I
past I
several I
months I
, O
even O
in O
West I
Germany I
, O
which I
has O
been O
by O
far I
Commodore I
's B
strongest I
market I
. O

The I
Commodore I
64 I
and I
128 I
, O
mainly O
used O
for O
children I
's B
educational I
software I
and I
games I
, O
had O
surprised O
market I
researchers I
by O
continuing O
to O
produce O
strong I
sales I
even O
though O
other I
low-profit I
personal I
computers I
now O
operate O
several I
times I
as O
fast O
and O
have O
much O
more I
memory I
. O

Commodore I
has O
said O
it I
expects O
sales I
to O
rebound O
, O
but O
market I
researchers I
have O
said O
that O
sales I
of O
the I
low-end I
products I
may O
finally O
be O
trailing O
off O
. O

prices I
closed O
slightly O
higher O
in O
the I
first I

since O
Friday I

Some I
issues I
were O
affected O
by O
Tuesday I

devastating I
earthquake I
in O
the I
San I

continued O
to O
slow O
from O
the I
hectic I
pace I
set O
during O
the I

late B
Friday I
and O
its I

Monday B
, O
as O
players I
began O
to O
set O
their I
sights I
on O
events I
coming O
later O
this I
week I
. O

The I
Dow I

Industrial I
Average I
drifted O
through O
the I
session I
within O
a I
trading I
range I
of O
about I
30 I

before O
closing O
with O
a I

of O

advanced O
in O

. O

But O
the I
Dow I

went O
down O
for O
the I
seventh I

, O
due O
largely O
to O
